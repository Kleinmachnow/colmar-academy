Capstone Project 
For this project, the last lesson on typographie and pseudo classes helped me to transform the user experience on the website. The mobile experience did not work as well as I was expected and I got stuck to re-size the boxes properly.The same goes for the style "reset" that I left blank as I did not know what to add there.
It was one of the most challenging project I had to perform so far.
